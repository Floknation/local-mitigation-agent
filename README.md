#Introduction

This tool has been developped to help network engineer to deal with undesirable traffic that is passing throught their Internet network. This tool has been design to propose a graphical user interface to manage network features like:

* Filter traffic with BGP flowspec,
* Drop malicious traffic with BGP blackhole,
* Design and configuration of RTBH (Remote Trigered Blackhole),
* Interface analytics system,
* ... 

This first version is currently Alpha and needs to go through a set of test to make it an usable version. For now, it is only supporting BGP flowspec (RFC5575).
